# SimpliVity

The powershell scripts here can be used to build an integration of SimpliVity backups with third party backup software. The example of the prebackup script here is build for SimpliVity backup and Veeam Availability Suite integration, but it can be adjusted for other third party backup software as needed.

The following powershell scripts are available:

OmniStackCmds.psm1          - SimpliVity 380 Rest API powershell commands v1 (OmniStack v.3.7.3)
SimpliVity-PS-Cmdlets.psm1  - HPE SimpliVity Rest API powershell commands v2 (OmniStack v.3.7.6U1)

createXMLbackupfile.ps1     - used to create the  XML parameter file (SvtBackupJob.xml) together with encryption key (AES.key) that is used to encrypt the password of the single-sign on user, that is needed to communicate with the OVC, the VMware vCenter and the Veeam backup server.

prebackup.ps1  -  prebackup script that can be used for a single VM backup

prebackup.ResourcePool.ps1  - prebackup script that can be used if a VMware resource pool needs to be backed up

postbackup.ps1 - postbackup clean up script


The scripts are tested with a HPE SimpliVity 380 cluster running OmniStack 3.7.3 together Veeam Availability Suite 9.5.
